# cpp-starter

this repo is mainly based on [lefticus/cpp_starter_project](https://github.com/lefticus/cpp_starter_project)  
with my own improvements.

## Conan

this repo uses conan for package management. to install conan use `pip install conan` and look at the [wiki.](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/getting_started.html)

Note: if you want to use different conan config dirs, you can set the CONAN_USER_HOME environment variable to set another config dir.
